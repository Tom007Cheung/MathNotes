**** Proposition Calculus/Proposition Logic
***** Definition 1
****** Let /p/ be a proposition. The /negation/ of /p/, denoted by /\neg p/, is the statement
       "It is not the case that p".
****** The proposition /not p/ is read "not /p/". The truth value of the negation of /p/, /not p/, is the opposite of the truth value of /p/.
